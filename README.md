# PlaNetarium

In-development Godot library for N-body orbital dynamics simulation, wherein multiple 'Gravitors' (stars, planets, moons, etc.), moving along fixed Keplerian orbital tracks, generate gravity that acts on 'Gravitees' (satellites, spacecraft, etc.). Designed with a focus on game development (real-time performance and easy interactability) rather than actual orbital analysis.
